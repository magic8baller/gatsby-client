        My passion for the subject of Yoga has gifted me with enthusiasm and
        knowledge. It is my mission to ignite the flame of curiosity in others
        and to use yoga tools to live more completely. I specialize in the
        practice of Iyengar Yoga in my home, Yoga studios and Community centers
        to bring knowledge to students in a non-competitive, safe and supportive
        manner.

        I was introduced to Yoga as a teen and responded positively but hadn’t
        the vision of where Iyengar Yoga would later take me. I experienced
        subtle aspects of my mind and my body that revealed to be spiritual,
        profound and unforgettable. While recovering from a neck and shoulder
        injury I rediscovered Yoga. I healed and challenged myself to master the
        poses and gained self-esteem, confidence and a sense of empowerment. I
        learned how to manage physical pain, mental stress and strain. Yoga by
        its very nature teaches how to cope with stress and stay centered as
        life and health challenges arise to bring relief and a sense of
        wellbeing.{" "}

        For the past 12 years my studies have continued. In 2008 and 2012, I
        travelled to Pune, India and studied directly with the Iyengar family.
        My teachers in the United States have been Mary Dunn, James Murphy and
        Carrie Owerko in NYC, Patricia Walden in Cambridge, MA, Dean and Rebecca
        Lerner in Lemont, PA and Diana Treglia in Brooklyn, NY, whose knowledge
        and wisdom has been priceless as are the lessons learned.

        I am a Brooklyn born resident and earned a BA in Psychology from
        Brooklyn College. I currently hold licenses in Real Estate, Mortgage
        Brokerage and Insurance in NY relating to the businesses my husband and
        I developed while raising our family.
